Embark
======


EMBARK is a fictitious digital marketing campaigns company that promotes products, services, brands and events. We set out to imagine, plan and learn how best to setup a digital agency as three recent graduates with skills in design and development. Github was used to allow easy collaboration when writing our business plan.

### Website

You can view the proposed [Embark creative site](http://thisisembark.com "Embark site") online.

### Landing Page

Phil setup this page to be used before the site was ready to launch.

### Node

Part of our pitch was to show use of some interactive features. We created a button on our site that would cause our presentation to shut off with a TV animation and leave a nice not for our audience. 

This is a basic sockets server setup to allow us to create this interaction.
