Embark
======

Embark is a fictitious digital marketing campaigns company that promotes products, services, brands and events. We set out to imagine, plan and learn how best to setup a digital agency as three graduates with skills in design and development. Github was used to allow easy collaboration when writing our business plan.

This repo contains the work for our business plan, which can be viewed in it's respective folder, broken into specific sections for development. You can also find the development behind the first landing page, website and presentation. 

You can view the proposed [Embark creative site](http://thisisembark.com "Embark site") and the [slides](http://thisisembark.com/presentation "Embark slides") used for the embark presentation online.

### Node

Part of our pitch was to show use of some interactive features. We created a button on our site that would cause our presentation to shut off with a TV animation and leave a nice not for our audience. 

This is a basic sockets server setup to allow us to create this interaction.
