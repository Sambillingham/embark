### Political

### Economical

#### The economic climate in the UK

The amount of money that companies, especially SMEs, are likely to spend on marketing and brand promotion depends on the state of the economy.

#### Expenses

As any costs for our raw materials increases/decrease, we have to decide if we want this change to be forced on our customers, or ourselves.

A lot of the software we will use will be industry leading, and will therefore have considerable costs involved to license them. We will therefore need to consider exactly what software is appropriate to us, and how many licenses we will need.

#### Interest rates

If we decide to loan money, this is obviously a very important factor that needs consideration.

#### Inflation

This is always an issue. It will affect many things from how much we will need to pay ourselves to the prices we charge.

#### Exchange rates

This should not affect us during the start-up process because we’re not planning on trading international during this time. This is something that can be reviewed in the future. 

### Social

#### Lifestyle changes/consumer attitudes

It is important to keep up with the latest trends by constantly reevaluating our designs and strategies.

#### Demographics

Each marketing campaign may need to be catered to a specific demographic. This is important to consider during development.

#### Media/customer opinions

We need to be aware of favourable subjects and avoid negatively viewed subjects.

#### Major events

Knowledge of popular social events is key. It could be possible to use these events during our marketing campaigns.

#### Religion

Religious beliefs may affect the strategy you adopt for a particular market.

#### Green Issues

How strong/weak the population’s opinion on green issues is.

### Technological

#### Emerging technology

Due to the type of company we are, this is imperative. We need to be aware of every new piece of technology that we can take advantage of and implement into out marketing strategies. This is what will keep us at the forefront of our sector, and ahead of the competition.#### R&D funding

It may be possible to secure research and development funding when looking into new technology.#### Understanding technology shelf life

As well as discovering new technologies, it is important to know when old ones are no longer ideal for the task in hand. #### Intellectual property issues

For any IP we create that does not belong to a client, we must make sure we protect it with the relevant patents.#### Communications

Awareness of how our clients communicate.
