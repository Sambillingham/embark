### Strengths

Less money is being spent on marketing campaigns, this allow us to step in and propose a cheaper but more efficient option of digital campaigns and online experiences. 

Low cost of running day to day, we have minimal overheads.s

Multi disciplinary staff are flexible to the current workload wether it be more design, development or physical computing. We can work on multiple smaller jobs as each person at embark can work in any area.

Can take on large projects that span over many months while simultaneously working on smaller projects or standard digital agency work. 

Straight out of university, enthuasitic, motivated, innovative, different and creative, this is proven with high grades and multiple successful projects.

"In future" Embark can quickly turn around projects when needed and could charge a premium for the ability to do this, becoming know for creating products quickly when needed to by clients.

Focus on a strong work ethic even if it means taking longer or spending more money.

More than just digital agency work.

Technically capable, able to learn on the job taking on new tasks and learning new skills easily.

As we sell digital products and services we are able to have long distance client and geographical location becomes less relevant.

Current connections in the South West, swell as active online presence.

### Weakness

With limited experience and a small portfolio it may be difficult to show or prove our potential. 

We may need to spend a lot of money on hiring equipment during our startup process as we can't afford to buy it and may need it for projects. 

Hard to distinguish our field of work because we can do a wide variety of projects across the digital field. 

We're setup in the South West which has lack of exposure for digital agencies.

Our staff have limited real-world experience with only 1 year in industry each.

Lack of sales experience and networking to create business.


### Opportunity
