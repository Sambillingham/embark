## Slide 1 - Embark Logo

**Phil**: Hi. We're here today to introduce you to the business we are going to be starting in July this year. This is Embark.

## Slide 2 - Mission statement

**Chris**: Our mission is to build award winning campaigns and engaging experiences through digital innovation. 

## Slide 3 - Products

**Sam**: As a creative campaigns company, we create experiences for our clients that engage their customers. We have decided to split our services onto three areas to make it easier for clients to know what they need and what we can offer.

**Phil**: 
- Our digital services consist of all the things a client may need in order to create a tailored online campaign.
- We design and build websites, including responsive sites that can adapt to all devices, for clients looking to sell products, services, or to promote a brand or event online.
- We have experience with technologies such as Node.js and MQTT, which provide us with a good platform for developing realtime data visualisations and web applications.
- We can also develop applications for android and iOS devices as part of a digital campaign.

**Chris**: Experiential focuses on interaction devices, as well as installations to be placed in public spaces. These engage with participants in a unique way, whether this be [an installation that translates people's footsteps into a visualisation on a big screen] or [a talking head that reacts to the motion of people walking past]. Our interaction devices are built on internet-of-things technologies, using Arduino and Raspberry pie platforms. Each installation will be tailored for our clients, [enabling the maximum publicity possible] for the product, service or event they are promoting.

**Sam**: Production. Our third area is video production. We are able to provide quality production services offering documentaries, interviews and showcase style videos as well as motion graphics and visual effects.


## Slide 4 - Who are we

**Chris**: As Technical Director I have developing roles in both our web services and our physical interaction devices and experiences. With a years experience in London working on the back end development of touch screen kiosks and capabilities in multiple programming languages I am able to develop functional interactive devices for our clients.

**Sam**: As managing Director I work to keep Embark on the cutting edge by keeping up-to-date with current technologies, web trends and news. Confident in design and development I am able to work both on the technical development of projects as well as creative design. After my placement year in Australia working both as an Online specialist and in content creation, I am well trained in high quality video production and will take the lead in this area.

**Phil** My role as Creative Director is to lead projects in terms of design and functionality.

# Slide 5 - USP

**sam**: As a company we want to focus on three main aspects to be better than our competition. 


-  Latest technology and innovation.
-  Polished products with attention to detail.
-  Transparent

we aim to bing the wow factor by combing these three aspects into all of our projects.

# Finance

**Chris**:

## First year cash flow
- Startup costs
-- Server management
-- cloud backup
-- Domain name
-- networking
-- company house registration
-- professional fees (start up docs, shareholders agreement)

counteracted with our initial investment of £1500 (900/600)
on day one we start with a positive balance of £145.70

other expenses throughout the year, which will be paid monthly are:
- internet
- server managent
- a version control system
- project software (adobe creative suite/vimeo+)
- google apps for business
- Free agent (accounting software)
- insurance
- Business space (formation zone)

*Wages*
we will not pay ourselves for the first two months to get Embark off the ground. After this, £900pppm
This ensures that we stay in the positive whilst spending time networking

*income*
we've split our jobs into four categories or work
First we have promotional work…
we have small jobs…
medium jobs are…
large jobs are…

During the first month, we project that we will get 5 dye total of promotional work. This is not a huge amount, but it's a realistic target, and will help us in promoting ourselves to potential clients. As we start are not paying ourselves, we stay in the positive.

As the year progresses, we will predict we will get 2-3 days promotional work per month and 4-5 days of small jobs per month.

Our first medium job will be taken on in the 4th month, with our first large 2 week + job being taken on in the 7th month.

This all ensures a steady increase in our income, leading to a steadily increasing balance.

At the end of the first year, the drops you see on the chart occur because of extra payments in the final month. The are for accounts, company house payment, repaying £500 of initial investment and £1000 to be spent on new equipment.

## Break even chart

Our total expenses for the first year are 36,170.96. Assuming that we are receiving £400 for every full day worked, Embark needs to have 91.5 days of fully paid work to break even.

## 3 year cash flow

during the second and third year, we will no longer take on promotional work. we will have a steadily decreasing number of days spent working on small jobs, and a steadily increasing number of days spent on medium and large jobs. During the second year, we will increase our daily rate to £500 and during the third year, to £600.

We will also move out of the formation zone and into our own office. This will cost £240 per month. Wages will also be increased £900 - £1500 - £2500.

At the end of the second year, We will spend £10000 on new equipment, increase our wages to £2500pm and employee a new member to the team at £2000pm. All of these expenses, coupled with corporation tax explains the large drop in total balance you see on the chart.

# Operations 

**Sam**: 
*location*
We will be living and working in a house in plymouth to allow us to reach our audience in the South West. Sharing a house allows us to save money. We'll be applying for a space within the Formation-zone to present ourselves more processionally with a place to meet clients and use for a postal address while still keeping our running costs low.

*workflow*
As you might have seen we already own 'thisisembark.com' and our site is currently live, using google apps we'll be using company email @thisisembark.com. 

we plan to use git as our version control system, and Github to allow us to collaborate on projects easily. When we begin to work more on video production we'll purchase a Vimeo plus account allowing us more uploads and HD content.

We've decided to use a managed VPS for hosting of our client work and projects, A managed system still allows us additional control where we may need for innovative projects but takes away the haste and time restraints of managing our own server and the responsibilities that comes with that.

*equipment*
We are able to begin work right away as we all have our own computers as well as a DSLR and prototyping equipment in the form of Arduino and Raspberry pies. We may need to rent some equipment
