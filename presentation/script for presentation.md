## Slide 1 - Embark Logo

**Phil**: Hi. We're here today to introduce you to the business we are going to be starting in July this year. This is Embark.

## Slide 2 - Mission statement

**Chris**: Our mission is to build award winning campaigns and engaging experiences through digital innovation. 

## Slide 3 - Products

**Sam**: As a creative campaigns company, we create experiences for our clients that engage their customers. We have decided to split our services onto three areas to make it easier for clients to know what they need and what we can offer.

**Phil**: Digital encompasses our online campaigns. It focuses on the aspects of responsive web design, data visualisations and applications. Our landing pages and micro-site campaigns will engage with our clients' customers to attract them to the product, service or event being promoted. Creating realtime web applications will interact with customers in a different way [how?]. Our data visualisations will create a new online experience for it's audience.

**Chris**: Experiential focuses on interaction devices, as well as installations to be placed in public spaces. These engage with participants in a unique way, whether this be [an installation that translates people's footsteps into a visualisation on a big screen] or [a talking head that reacts to the motion of people walking past]. Our interaction devices are built on internet-of-things technologies, using Arduino and Raspberry pie platforms. Each installation will be tailored for our clients, enabling the maximum publicity possible for the product, service or event they are promoting.

**Sam**: Production. Production. We are able to provide quality production services offering documentaries, interviews and showcase style videos as well as motion graphics and effects.
