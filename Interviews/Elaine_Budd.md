**Chris** - Hello

**Elaine** - Hello

**Chris**  - Hello

**Elaine** - Hello, is that Christopher?

**Chris**  - It's Chris yeah. Is that Elaine? How are you?

**Elaine** - Alright thank you. Is it convenient?

**Chris**  - Yeah, it's fine

**Elaine** - Ok, well tell me what you're up to and what you're trying to do... and I'll do my best to help, if I can

**Chris**  - Well thanks for calling us.  Well, basically, I've got my two colleagues here as well, Phil and Sam.  Basically, we're finishing our final year at uni.  In the next couple of months we're looking to set up a creative agency. So we've got into contact with you because we're looking to focus on campaigns and events, and maybe some installations as well, in the Southwest.  So I was wondering, first of all, if I could get some information about your background and what you do?

**Elaine** - Yes of course! I started my career in marketing, and I'm getting on a bit now unfortunately. So I started a web company in the beginning of 96. Web wasn't very widespread then and mostly used by 'techies' and, especially in the west country, not many people knew about it. So what was our strength in terms of setting up early?... weakness was that not many people knew what it was all about so I ended up doing an awful lot of work in the Southeast. The web company grew to about 12 or so staff with contractors as well. We were based as the Tamar Science park and our biggest contract was with British Homestores International and we did their online supply chain. Basically all of their franchises across the world, Middle-East and Eastern Europe ordered their stock via this site. Now the reason we were early was because we could see how important this could be, the internet as a thing, not just a technical system. So, I sold that company in 2004. Now I work as a project manager, which is what I did for that company anyway really. I get involved in a wide range of things because projects are projects, whether its... if you've got the project management skills it doesn't matter whether its a design project, or a build, or an event. So I work on a range of projects, from events to economic development, to skills initiatives. So a real broad brush. I do have kind-of-a creative background because the one company I set up, was looking at solving business needs so basically its all about relationships. So I'd build a relationship with a company, and not only would they want an IT system, but maybe a new branding, so I'd work with design agencies to develop the branding, to apply that to any business solution that we were doing.  And then you'd get asked for printing.  So I ended up with quite a few different companies around me, to provide a complete solution...so a lot with agencies.

**Chris**  - Essentially what we're trying to do is... we're looking into promoting brands, products, services and events.  So we're looking at making mobile websites, data visualisations and applications.

**Elaine** - So a real suite of services for business then?

**Chris**  - Yeah, and we wanted to do some interactive installations as well.  So to get things out there... for example there's an example of an installation where they had a piano... So they had a staircase and they turned it into a giant piano so every time you walked on the steps it played the sounds.  There was an escalator next to it and the purpose of it was to get people to use the stairs more.  They obviously succeeded in that, because people used the steps a lot more than the escalator even though it was right next to it.  So in that sense, that was more to encourage people to use the stairs but in our sense...  We wanted to find some cool ideas that we could do with technology and to promote brands and products with it as well.  We really wanted to know if you know anything about the levels of interest in the Southwest for this sort of thing, and if there is a demand for it?  We heard that you get involved with the graduation fair as well... 

**Elaine** - No I don't do much for graduation… I mentioned that to Dawn when I responded. I'm an independent project manager so I do some work for the for the university but I also do some work for the chamber and the city, and what have you. I do some work for the university, but the events I get involved in tend to be more community based. Lisa Phillips has led on the graduation, but the company that has done that is a company called Chaos Productions… and they've done the putting together the event in term of marquees, staging, lighting, and all of the associated kit.

**Chris** - Ok, thats brilliant. From your experience of the events you've managed, have you seen any swaying towards using… because we're basically going towards this whole wow factor with everything we do.  So it would be like one-off digital installations or campaigns to capture peoples attentions and to, if it's a product, promote their product… and the same with services and events.  So we were just wondering if there was…

**Elaine** - So sort of big campaigns for events and upcoming events? I know a company in Exeter that does the outsourcing for events.  If you're putting on an event they'll either manage the whole thing, in terms of putting together the conference pack, the venue, the lighting, the staging, the web… they do the whole lot.  Or they can just provide campaigns to market the event.  Now, they're not based in Plymouth… the sort of events that you're going to be looking at doing, I suspect, are going to be closer to Exeter/Bristol rather than Plymouth.

**Chris** - Ok, so is there more of a market there for this kind of thing?

**Elaine** - I would think so.  I'm more than happy to put some thoughts down on paper for you and some contacts… I'm afraid the creativity that's displayed in the city tends to be more on the artistic side of things rather than the mainstream, which is something that has frustrated me for some time.  I think if you merged… you should look at [emerging] world as much as you can. I organised a launch for Respect at the University last week and we had a range of people from across the community. So it included business people, arts people, police, fire… a real mix.  And we had confetti-cannons going off, and dancers… now the dancers were scantily clad but culturally accurate.  But it was beautiful. It's really interesting to see people's reactions.  They're not used to having that kind of creativity in front of them.

**Chris** - That's the sort of effect we were going for…

**Elaine** - What's interesting was, cis' I was actually operating some kites, it was all hands on deck… so I was operating some kites on the first floor of RLB, and it's really interesting to see peoples reactions.  It actually makes people… it takes away their barriers.  It suddenly becomes… not business, and they're not quite sure, so I'm thoroughly supportive of what you're trying to do.  So I think you've got to pair up with some people who are equally as visionary, if you were going to do anything in Plymouth… Now there is obviously the city of culture bid that has been produced, and that should, I hope, encourage some more creative thinking.  And therefore I would hope that people who are getting involved with events would be therefore keen to display some creative thinking in order to support that kind of initiative… There's other interesting things such as the 'Plymouth Making Waves Project'. Are you familiar with that?

**Chris** - No, I've not heard of that.

**Elaine** - They've done it in various other cities, where cities have sculptures on a theme.  People will decorate them, they'll form a trail.  Plymouth is doing something on marine life, working with various companies to produce sculptures of marine life that will then be decorated.  Hopefully, I would like to think, it going to be produced in materials that demonstrate each companies skills, so maybe composites from the marine industry.  And then community groups and artists will decorate them.  They'll create a trail around the city and then they'll be auctioned-off to raise funds for an environmental project.  It is a replication of another idea, it's not innovative but it's showing that people are prepared to be just a little more creative.

**Chris** - So Plymouths on the, sort of, creative cusp… it's not quite there yet…

**Elaine** - Yes, it's becoming more mainstream.  There'll be stuff… and there's talented people around.  But you'll find the creative stuff is a bit more 'fringe'.  It's a bit more at the experimental end, where you have a particular audience.  It doesn't move into the more mainstream.  However, that said, people like the media innovation network… I'm just sort of jotting down ideas down here… the company I mentioned in Exeter,  event companies maybe, looking for ways of gaining attention for events or products, or whatever, in a more creative way.  So I guess really I just need to put my thinking-cap on and think about a range of contacts for you.

**Chris** - That would be really helpful

**Elaine** - Yes, I'd be happy to. I think what you're doing is great and I'd like to see more of it…  At the moment I don't have any funding, but I'm just thinking… Are you familiar with the 'Respect' festival?  It takes place in the city.  It's been done on a shoestring for about 14 years and it's about celebrating cultural diversity and difference.  This is what I was launching last week.  It takes place in October, and there's a very serious message around it because it's organised by the Racial Equality Council. But the University are now hosting and supporting it. It's got a theme that runs through the activities that they do, called 'Step Up for Respect' which is about saying 'What are you going to do to stand up for peoples rights', etc.  The associated artwork, installations, the parade that will go throughout the town, will reflect a theme.  This year the action is 'flying'.  So its going to be 'Flying with Respect'.  We've been talking with departments, including the 3D and arts departments about making these things… When do you actually finish your course?

**Chris** - We don't finish fully until the end of June, so we're looking to start up pretty much as soon as we finish

**Elaine** - I'm wondering whether… wouldn't it be great if you could do something for that.

**Chris** - Yes, to start we just need to get out there and get noticed, so that sort of thing would be brilliant.

**Elaine** - Yeah, that's the thing.  Sometimes when you first start a business you have to… almost give stuff away a little bit.

**Chris** - From the research we've done we've come to accept that.  We need to get a portfolio together and to do that we need to do that sort of thing.

**Elaine** - Yes, that's one of the things I would certainly recommend.  You look for some high profile events and you offer your services, and you see if you can make a splash to get yourself noticed. I'll send you all these details. The reason I'm thinking about Respect in October is, or something you can do in the lead-up to promote it, is that they're open to creativity because of the nature of the event. It's all music, dance…

**Chris** - I suppose it would provide a lot of positive feedback if you get involved with stuff like that...

**Elaine** - I'm just wondering if there's anything else I can help you to get involved in before June...

**Chris** - Well, everything you've said so far has been very useful.  So if you can give us a link to, or a list of contacts that would be fantastic.

**Elaine** - Is there anything else I can do for you?

**Chris** - I think that's pretty much it. We're still finishing the whole process of doing the business plan…

**Elaine** - Well I'm more than happy to cast my eye over that because I've had a couple of businesses. The legal profession and the accountancy profession, you need them as tools but they're not the right people to advise you on this really.  They're not creative… I'm more than happy to do anything I can to help.  Your going to have to start getting out and networking, so I'll try to help open some doors for you. I'll out you in touch with some people and throw some information at you and you can take or dismiss what you like.

**Chris** - Ok, thank you very much for this phone call and for taking the time out of your day to talk to us.

**Elaine** - Ok well let me get some stuff on paper, we'll have an email to and fro, and we'll see where we go from there.

**Chris** - Ok, well thank you very much. Hopefully we speak to you soon.

**Elaine** - Take care. Bye.
