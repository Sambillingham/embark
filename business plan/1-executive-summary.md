## 1.3. Products and Services

When you start with great techniques, good eye for design and the most creative uses of technology, the results far outweigh current attempts of competition. 

Embark is not here to create another email campaign, to set up pay-per-click advertising, or adwords, which rarely make an impact when a company is trying to get a message out there.  Embarks selection of services enable businesses to **actually** make people aware of their brand, products.

Embark's services are split into three main categories; *Digital*, *Experiential*, and *Production*. These categories have been created in order to help the client choose a solution that is right for them. Clients do not have to commit to a specific package, but instead, can choose the products and services that best suit their individual needs or can be directed by Embark and not choose at all.

**Digital** - Encompasses all the services clients may need for creating tailored online campaigns. This includes micro-sites, landing pages, responsive websites for clients looking to sell products, services, or to promote a brand or event online. 

Embark also offers real-time visualisations for the web, enabling clients to communicate information through graphical means. Embark's data Visualisations bring aesthetic form and functionality together to create an individual experience for clients customers that stimulate engagement and attention. 

Embark offers custom built native mobile applications and is always focused on bringing high quality design to all projects and stands above the crowd online.

**Experiential** - Embark offers bespoke digital solutions, in the form as interactive installations and interaction devices. Focusing on engaging clients customers in unique ways by building specific interaction on the Arduino and Raspberry pie prototyping platforms. When prototypes are complete Embark create custom products which are released separately or integrate into clients product, event, building, stand or whatever is required. Each installation will be tailored for our clients, enabling the maximum publicity. With the rise of the internet-of-things this service can be fully integrated with online technologies and other Embark digital services.

Clients can either approach the company with an idea, or alternatively an innovative solution, that best suits their needs, can be created. 

**Production** - Covers the video production services Embark provides. Professional demonstrations, documentaries, interviews and showcase videos can be produced for clients. Inline with the industry standard Embark uses Digital SLR camera's and multiple lenses to film events or products for showcasing, creating quality content. Custom videography and photography can be integrated into any of the services we offer. 

Within Production we also offer Motion graphics, animations and visual effects to combine with other services. Video work is fantastic in any setting but excels in the digital environment online.
