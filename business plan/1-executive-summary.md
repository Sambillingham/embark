Embark's services are split into three main categories; *Digital*, *Experiential*, and *Production*.

Clients do not have to commit to a specific package, but instead, can choose the products and services that suit their needs.

**Experiential** - Embark offers bespoke digital solutions, such as interactive installations, for experiential marketing campaigns and events.  Clients can either come to us with an idea, or alternatively we can generate an innovative solution that best fits their needs.

**Production** - Covers the video production services Embark provides. Demonstrations, documentaries, or animations are just a few examples of the types of video we can produce.
