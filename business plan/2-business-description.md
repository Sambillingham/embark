# Business Description

## Risks and Assumptions

- We will not be paid for the first two months living on money form our parents, current overdraft and student loans
- We can live on reduced wages as we can all share accommodation.
- Each founder will add £300 into the business as an initial investment which will then be repaid in the final month of the first year.
- we have our own equipment in for the forms of computers, camera prototyping gear ( Arduino & rawberry Pie), software.
- We each have personal telephone lines which will be used to talk to business clients.
- Personal Cars can be used for transport.
- After speaking with contacts at the university we are assuming we have five promotional jobs as-well as three larger campaigns spread across the first year with the potential to be an annual recurrence if successful.
- With connections made through Elaine Bud we are confident we are able to secure at minimum two campaigns within this network.
- We have connections though placement year/ family/ friends who will be able to send work our way.

## 2.1. Company's Aims

- To be recognisable as a creative agency and digital campaigns company.
- To be recommended as a service within the South West Region.
- To create innovative and original digital campaigns.


### Aims for Five Years Time

* To have gained national recognition in the form of awards for websites, innovation and digital marketing.

* We expect to have taken on more employees to fill dedicated roles in design, development, administration, and to potentially have a position for a regular intern.

* Each employee will have access to industry standard hardware and software specific to their role.

* To have relocated to an area with greater client and financial potential.

* While it is not a priority, we are open to taking on work for international clients and would hope to have done so by this point.

* All of these developments will have gained us recognition as regional leaders in the production of creative marketing campaigns.

## 2.2. Management Team

### Sam Billingham

**Managing Director**

Sam is passionate about new technologies and the way they integrate into everyday life, he ensures every project is as innovative and unique as possible. Sam enjoys learning and researching about what’s new in the digital sector, and plays a large role in making Embark the cutting-edge digital marketing campaigns company. As a creative developer with skills in both development and design Sam is able to integrate closely with Chris and Phil and work on either area when necessary. 

### Chris Packard

**Technical Director**
Chris is a developer with a solid knowledge of multiple languages including Java, JavaScript, PHP and ASP.NET Razor. He has a varied experience in web design, android and web applications, HTML5 games, and back end development for touch screen kiosks. Chris is logically minded, bringing organisation and a methodical structure to the team.

### Phil Rose

Phil has extensive knowledge of web technologies and is proficient in user experience and interaction design.  With previous experience in online marketing, web design and front-end development, Phil brings the creative insight to the team.

#### Team Background

The three members involved with the company all have a genuine passion for design, development and technology.  

Being on the Digital Art and Technology course at Plymouth University has provided us with a varied set of skills within the digital sector.  Over the last four years we have had the chance to work together on several projects utilising latest technologies in creative ways.  The three members are known for having a good work ethic and have gained a systematic workflow over the duration of the course.

Each member has produced work of a professional standard for companies such as CVC Network, Eclipse Internet, KCOM Group, and Liquid Digital.

Based on our previous experience we witnessed how many businesses are stuck with outdated systems due to limitations of time or funding.  This often results in corner-cutting and therefore products and services are less effective as a result.  With Embark we are starting from scratch, so we are in a position to create a strategy, setting up a company that is as scalable and future proof as possible.  This is important in the ever-evolving digital sector as technological advancements are so frequent.

Our vision for Embark is to create a company that encourages creativity and 'out-of-the-box' thinking, taking the latest technologies and using them in engaging ways in order to market brands, products, services and events.

## 2.3. Specific Services

## 2.4. Business Structure

We have chosen to setup Embark as a Limited Liability Company (LLC), making Embark a legal identity in its own right.

First and foremost being an LLC is important because of the limited liability that it inherently offers, keeping potential loss to only the original investment made.  Being an LLC allows Embark to be set up with three initial directors, these being Sam Billingham, Chris Packard and Phil Rose, all sharing equal rights to the company.

Rather than generating all of the necessary legal documents and accounts for the company ourselves, we will hire the help of a professional formation agent (costs included in 6. Finance), to ensure no costly errors are made and to save time.

We have chosen 'companiesmadesimple', an approved partner of companies house, specifically the 'Silver' package they provide for £50.  Our setup includes all required documents, a Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles of Association.  This registers us with companies house and allows us to begin trading as soon as possible.

## 2.5. Legal

[time with solicitor]
[office insurance]
[loss of earnings insurance]
[data & server backup systems]
[data protection act]

**Public Liability Insurance** - Protecting Embark in the event of causing damage to property, or physical harm, injury or death to a third party as part of business activities conducted by Embark.

**Employer's Liability Insurance** - Protecting Embark in the event of claims being made by employees in cases of injury or sickness as a result of business activities conducted by Embark.

**Professional Indemnity Insurance** - Covers costs to Embark when there are claims made by dissatisfied clients for negligence, loss of data, or infringement of copyright.

**Directors and Officers Insurance** - Covers Embark for legal liabilities that directors may have and any cost if there are any mistakes.

**Legal Expense Insurance** - To cover Embark if there are any legal or court expenses.

It is important that Embark gains insurance cover for all possibilities, although it may not all be obligatory, any large interruption could put the company out of business. Therefore it is safer to pay the monthly insurance charges rather than any larger charges that Embark may incur should the insurance not be in place.

**T & C's**
As part of our setup we are using a free template for our terms and conditions and privacy policy that will relate to a general digital agency. We can have a solicitor draw up a specific set of terms and conditions as-well as a privacy policy when we deem in necessary in the future.

**Shareholder agreement**
It is important for Embark to have a possessional 3 person shareholder agreement for limited company written up by a solicitor before we start operations. Our initial cost for our shareholder agreement is £500 paid before we start business, shown in the financial forecast.
