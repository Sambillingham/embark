#### Team Background

The three members involved with the company all have a genuine passion for design, development and technology.  

Being on the Digital Art and Technology course at Plymouth University has provided us with a varied set of skills within the digital sector. Over the last four years we have had the chance to work together on several projects utilising latest technologies in creative ways. The three members are known for having a good work ethic and have gained a systematic workflow over the duration of the course.

Each member has produced work of a professional standard for companies such as CVC Network, Eclipse Internet, KCOM Group, and Liquid Digital.

Based on the previous experience of founding members who witnessed how many businesses are stuck with outdated systems due to limitations of time or funding. This often results in corner-cutting and therefore products and services are less effective as a result. Embark is a chance to start from scratch, putting it in a position to create a strategy, setting up a company that is as scalable and future proof as possible.  This is important in the ever-evolving digital sector as technological advancements are so frequent.

The Embark vision is to create a company that encourages creativity and 'out-of-the-box' thinking, taking the latest technologies and using them in engaging ways in order to market brands, products, services and events.

## 2.5. Business Structure

Founders have chosen to setup Embark as a Limited Liability Company (LLC), making Embark a legal identity in its own right.

First and foremost being an LLC is important because of the limited liability that it inherently offers, keeping potential loss to only the original investment made.  Being an LLC allows Embark to be set up with three initial directors, these being Sam Billingham, Chris Packard and Phil Rose, all sharing equal rights to the company.

Rather than generating all of the necessary legal documents and accounts for the company ourselves, a professional formation agent will be hired (costs included in 6. Finance), to ensure no costly errors are made and to save time.

'companiesmadesimple' has been selected, an approved partner of companies house, specifically the 'Silver' package they provide for £50.  Setup includes all required documents, a Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles of Association.  This registers Embark with companies house so the company can begin trading as soon as possible.

## 2.6. Legal

- [time with solicitor]

- [office insurance]

- [loss of earnings insurance]

- [data & server backup systems]

- [data protection act]

**Public Liability Insurance** - Protecting Embark in the event of causing damage to property, or physical harm, injury or death to a third party as part of business activities conducted by Embark.

**Employer's Liability Insurance** - Protecting Embark in the event of claims being made by employees in cases of injury or sickness as a result of business activities conducted by Embark.

**Professional Indemnity Insurance** - Covers costs to Embark when there are claims made by dissatisfied clients for negligence, loss of data, or infringement of copyright.

**Directors and Officers Insurance** - Covers Embark for legal liabilities that directors may have and any cost if there are any mistakes.

**Legal Expense Insurance** - To cover Embark if there are any legal or court expenses.

It is important that Embark gains insurance cover for all possibilities, although it may not all be obligatory, any large interruption could put the company out of business. Therefore it is safer to pay the monthly insurance charges rather than any larger charges that Embark may incur should the insurance not be in place.

**T&C's** - As part of our setup we are using a free template for our terms and conditions and privacy policy that will relate to a general digital agency. We can have a solicitor draw up a specific set of terms and conditions as-well as a privacy policy when we deem in necessary in the future.

**Shareholder agreement** - It is important for Embark to have a possessional 3 person shareholder agreement for limited company written up by a solicitor before we start operations. Our initial cost for our shareholder agreement is £500 paid before we start business, shown in the financial forecast.
