### Transcript of an interview with Louise Kent - Student Ambassador, Outreach

**Louise:** Let me just explain the current structure of the recruitment sector of Plymouth University. We all work under the umbrella of student services. We have *'Recruitment'* and *'Outreach'*, which are the two departments that work together to recruit people to the university. Outreach works specifically with a certain brand of people - people who come from low income families, people who are disabled, ethnic minority groups and adult learners. So very specific groups of people. Whereas *'Recruitment'* is the marketing side of it. So they're the people that go out to the UCAS fares and do all that kind of stuff. Outreach splits itself into different categories. I work specifically with the Arts faculty. My job is to recruit people that Outreach target to courses within the Arts faculty. To do this we'll go into schools, send academics into schools, and bring people onto the campus to give them an idea of what student life is like. All of outreach work with the same set of targets to recruit certain numbers of the different groups of people I listed earlier. The recruitment sector target everybody, but ours is specific, so we will do what is necessary for all of our faculties in order to recruit people from all of these different backgrounds. There are a number of target groups that we know have a large population in this area - people who have low incomes, people who's parents have never been to university etc. The way that we judge that we're hitting the right targets is to get every student we work with to fill in a form (see Appendix B.). This information will then be collated to work out if we're hitting our targets of recruiting from each of the groups. I hope that gives you a good background into what we do.

**Chris** That's brilliant. I guess what what we want to know is how you go about this. What sort of things to you do when you find the groups of people you're targeting.

**Louise** It depends. For Arts specifically, we partly work with the schools, so if one of the schools in the university says we want to find people for Architecture, we ask them what things they do that might be interesting for young people, or for the people we are targeting. They will then decide on an idea. So for example, for Architecture we ran an event which involved getting current university students and students from local secondary schools together. They worked one day in the school and one day at the university. to give them a bit of a bond, and to see the university, work on a project with those people, and then have a chance to present their projects. It's aimed to be quite fun and we try to keep things quite vibrant and exciting. We try and raise aspirations and encourage them to push to get a place here. A lot of people we work with are on a C-grade boundary so we try to give them the extra push to get the grades they need. Almost anything we do will involve a campus tour, meeting students, seeing a lecture theatre, seeing a seminar environment, that kind of thing. This is all to see what university is like, usually from the view of one subject, but that depends on who is running the session.

**Chris** So for every situation, is there some sort of workshop  involved?

**Louise** For the majority it will be either a workshop, but for the more general sessions, they will do more presentations followed by an activity. We find that for specific subjects, it's much easier to do a workshop because we can show exactly what the university offers for that subject. 

**Chris** So are most, if not all, of the workshops run by students?

**Louise** They are usually run by academics, depending on who's available and the subjects we are looking at, and it will be supported by myself, or one of my colleagues doing all of the background work, filling places, getting everything set up, and then the students will do most of the interaction throughout the day, because they're the important people to talk to. 

**Sam** Obviously there is some sort of budget involved. Could you give us any idea of how much you normally allocate to events?

**Louise** It depends on which part of the university are holding the event. So for example Science and Technology will have a budget, Arts will have a budget etc. The Science and Technology faculty is bigger out of the two. I can't give exact figures, but if we were looking at a fairly large event you are probably looking between one and two thousands pounds for an event that maybe a hundred to two hundred people will turn up to.

**Chris** That's great. In terms of what we can do, we are looking into creating a campaigns company that campaigns both online, and in the physical world. We were looking at making fun interactive objects and installations, and placing them in public spaces to get people to interact with them and, in doing so, promote products, services, events and brands. From the research we have completed so far, there isn't any businesses that are doing this in the South West. An example of what we do is an interactive, large scale floor piano, that plays notes when people step on it's keys. It doesn't have to necessarily relate to the brand, it just has to catch their attention. So we was looking at how we could maybe do something like this for your events to promote courses. 

**Louise** Yes, absolutely. We quite often have a lunch or break period where students are in a space all together. Everyone loves a gimmick, and for us that is a major thing. That is why merchandising goes down so well. We always ALWAYS get asked for things like Plymouth University branded pens. So anything that is a quick hit or that students love is great. We usually work with students from around the ages of 13-17. They love anything that's a big hit, so actually that sort of thing would be great, as long as it has a message that sticks. Because for us it is really important that, although it does not necessarily have to be life changing, it has to be something that they will remember  for a reason. For us there would absolutely be scope for this type of thing. We spend a lot of the time in the Roland Levindsky crosspoint space, so an installation there would be great. Also, we have lots and lots of different workshops going on and they are subject specific, but if there was something that could be used and changed for each subject, that would be good.

**Sam** There's also course websites that we wanted to ask about. Our course has it's own website, but we wasn't sure how many other courses have that type of thing. And I was wondering if you could give us an insight as to whether this is something that other courses would be interested in.

**Louise** We're currently working on the *'Outreach'* part of the website. The university are currently in the process of changing the format of their website. But I don't think many other courses do have a website that we can send people to and certainly that is a big issue. So if we had somewhere to send people that would be amazing.

**Chris** As it stands all of the courses have a page on the Plymouth website, but maybe we could look into giving each course their own website to give them an identity, and hopefully generating higher popularity. 

**Louise** I think you'll have to talk to the branding people about that. I know that we [Outreach] are not allowed to stretch outside of the [Plymouth University] brand. So we can't have, for example, an 'Arts faculty' website, unless it is plymouth.ac.uk/something, because we have to be kept in that brand. We have to be very careful about the branding. We are looking into having our own branding under the Plymouth University brand to give us more of an identity.

**Sam** In terms of where go from here, do you have any ideas on how we might be of service to the university as a whole.

**Louise** I would need to know exactly what you can do, and then if I send that around my department, I'm sure some ideas will come up as to how we can utilise you and for the sorts of things we need as a whole. It would be nice if it was something that wasn't just Arts specific. I'm willing to try it out as Arts first, but if this is something that is going to work for us, then obviously the whole department will want in. We've got four different faculties. We have six different strands, so this could be something that benefits everybody. So if the message was quite generic it would be good if we could use it in a few different areas. So, if you could show me something in the form of some ideas, that would be great.

Hi Christian,

I’m a DAT student, currently working on the venture culture module. If possible, could you give us some guidance towards pricing structures? We are a team of three people developing creative digital campaigns for clients in the SouthWest.

Could you give us some advice on what you charge as a company in its third year?

Thanks for your time

Chris

Hey Chris,

You have to work out pricing structures back to front. First figure out your outgoings for each month, also look at what you want to pay your team members each month, and add on a profit margin so your company is profitable. Once you have this figure you see how much you need to make each month/year. There are on average 20 working days a month, and you probably won't have client work on each and every one of these days, so say 15 days. Divide your monthly costs by 15 and it should leave you with a figure of your 'daily rate', which is what you use as a base. You then calculate realistically how many days it will take to perform a project and multiply this by your daily rate. Voila!

I believe this is how I calculated things in VC, this is just off the top of my head! This is pretty much the formula for every year of the company, except your outgoings and profit margin should be increasing each year (more wages, bigger expenditures etc).

I hope this helps :)

Cheers

Christian

Hi Cookie

Thanks for your last reply. It was very useful. I was wondering if you could give me an idea as to how much web development work there is in Plymouth, especially for developments that incorporate modern web technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, Web GL etc.

Thanks again 

Chris

Hi Phil,

Thanks for getting in touch. Hope the module is going well! 

I can't give exact prices, but I can give you a general overview. Probably easiest to gauge things on a daily rate. Daily rates generally tend to range from £200 / day to £600 / day, depending on level of experience and location. Freelancers and small companies often sit nearer that bottom range, whereas experienced freelancers / experienced studios in bigger cities can be closer to the top of that range. Generally the closer to London or bigger cities you go, the more the rates go up.

It also depends on the type of work (mobile/web/games etc.) and also if it is bespoke / high quality or cheap and cheerful. High quality stuff usually comes at a premium. 

I hope that is of some use!

regards

Alex
