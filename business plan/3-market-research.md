# Market Research

## 3.1. Market Description

In Q1 2012 the UK entered a recession leading economic forecasts to predict a slighly turbulent market during 2013 (Forecasts for the UK Economy). This is likely to dampen consumer spending and therefore result in companies having less funding for marketing.  A lack of consumer spending may lead to people seeking to use relatively low-cost channels of communication, which are now more commonly internet-based, such as social networking (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Vimeo, etc) and email.

Marketing on the Internet in general has seen signficant growth. The UK **internet** share of total advertising expenditure rose from £2.64bn in 2007 to £4.48bn by 2011 (The Advertising Association/Warc Expenditure Report 2011), an increase of 68.4% over four years. While digital marketing is on the rise and is often found to result in more leads than traditional channels such as direct mail, it is expected that a larger percentage of marketing spend will be on digital campaigns. The economy is due to strengthen from 2014 onwards, as is the total expenditure on digital marketing.

In 2012 small-to-medium enterprises (SME's) made up 99 per cent of the 4.8 million businesses in the UK (Rhodes. 2012, Small Businesses and the UK Economy. House of Commons Library). Embark plans to target these SME's, hoping to capitalise on emerging technologies and the increased use of digital marketing. Our services will be aimed primarily, but not exclusively, at businesses in the Southwest.  In 2009 there were 464,735 registered private sector enterprises in the Southwest. If we suggest that 5 per cent of these businesses are in a position to invest in some sort of digital marketing, that still leaves over 23,000 businesses. We are aware that most event-based work for the type of services we provide will probably come from businesses based closer to Exeter and Bristol (Elaine Budd. Appendix E) as Plymouth tends to lack funding for more creative projects.

Figures [figure numbers] are based on a model from "Marketing Strategy: A Decision-Focussed Approach" (Walker, O. and Mullins, J. 2011). The model has been used in order to make a decision on the market segment Embark will target.  Figures [figure numbers] demonstrate the potential of the SME market based on how certain factors are weighted, and a rating of the companies position against these factors.  

The company already has potential client work for the coming year. Recruitment, part of Plymouth University's marketing department have displayed interest in working with us on generating video campaigns to promote courses, and also to produce engaging digital installations for open-days.  Elaine Budd (Project Manager and owner, Prensus Limited) has also registered interest in our creative services including possible commission for a flight-themed installation for Plymouth's Respect Festival in October.

## 3.4. Competitive Advantages

## 3.5. PEST Analysis

### Political

### Economical

#### The economic climate in the UK

The amount of money that companies, especially SMEs, are likely to spend on marketing and brand promotion depends on the state of the economy.

#### Expenses

As any costs for our raw materials increases/decrease, we have to decide if we want this change to be forced on our customers, or ourselves.

A lot of the software we will use will be industry leading, and will therefore have considerable costs involved to license them. We will therefore need to consider exactly what software is appropriate to us, and how many licenses we will need.

#### Interest rates

If we decide to loan money, this is obviously a very important factor that needs consideration.

#### Inflation

This is always an issue. It will affect many things from how much we will need to pay ourselves to the prices we charge.

#### Exchange rates

This should not affect us during the start-up process because we’re not planning on trading international during this time. This is something that can be reviewed in the future. 

### Social

#### Lifestyle changes/consumer attitudes

It is important to keep up with the latest trends by constantly reevaluating our designs and strategies.

#### Demographics

Each marketing campaign may need to be catered to a specific demographic. This is important to consider during development.

#### Media/customer opinions

We need to be aware of favourable subjects and avoid negatively viewed subjects.

#### Major events

Knowledge of popular social events is key. It could be possible to use these events during our marketing campaigns.

#### Religion

Religious beliefs may affect the strategy you adopt for a particular market.

#### Green Issues

How strong/weak the population’s opinion on green issues is.

### Technological

#### Emerging technology

Due to the type of company we are, this is imperative. We need to be aware of every new piece of technology that we can take advantage of and implement into out marketing strategies. This is what will keep us at the forefront of our sector, and ahead of the competition.

#### R&D funding

It may be possible to secure research and development funding when looking into new technology.

#### Understanding technology shelf life

As well as discovering new technologies, it is important to know when old ones are no longer ideal for the task in hand. 

#### Intellectual property issues

For any IP we create that does not belong to a client, we must make sure we protect it with the relevant patents.

#### Communications

Awareness of how our clients communicate.

## 3.6. SWOT Analysis

### Strengths

Less money is being spent on marketing campaigns, this allow us to step in and propose a cheaper but more efficient option of digital campaigns and online experiences. 

Low cost of running day to day, we have minimal overheads.s

Multi disciplinary staff are flexible to the current workload wether it be more design, development or physical computing. We can work on multiple smaller jobs as each person at embark can work in any area.

Can take on large projects that span over many months while simultaneously working on smaller projects or standard digital agency work. 

Straight out of university, enthusiastic, motivated, innovative, different and creative, this is proven with high grades and multiple successful projects.

"In future" Embark can quickly turn around projects when needed and could charge a premium for the ability to do this, becoming know for creating products quickly when needed to by clients.

Focus on a strong work ethic even if it means taking longer or spending more money.

More than just digital agency work.

Technically capable, able to learn on the job taking on new tasks and learning new skills easily.

As we sell digital products and services we are able to have long distance client and geographical location becomes less relevant.

Current connections in the South West, swell as active online presence.

### Weakness

With limited experience and a small portfolio it may be difficult to show or prove our potential. 

We may need to spend a lot of money on hiring equipment during our startup process as we can't afford to buy it and may need it for projects. 

Hard to distinguish our field of work because we can do a wide variety of projects across the digital field. 

We're setup in the South West which has lack of exposure for digital agencies.

Our staff have limited real-world experience with only 1 year in industry each.

Lack of sales experience and networking to create business.


### Opportunity 

Connections through the university offer streams of incoming work. Promoting courses at school, colleges and graduation fair.

Nothing else in the southwest is specialist in offering similar services. * need to back this up.

Web Dev meet ups, explay meet up and other events in the South-West always looking for more content/speakers.

Funding for new technologies, research, crowd funding. 

increase in economic activity boosting the available tuning for our clients.

Improvements to general publics technically competence, understanding of physical computing and the 'internet of things'  increases our services as a need for clients.

increase in smart mobile devices.

### Threats

More basic design/dev work has high competition with other digital agencies in the South West.

Increase in prices to hardware, software or equipment as well as ongoing cost of subscription services.

Physical/ internet of things events will be effected by the weather.

need for insurance and H&S for events/projects
