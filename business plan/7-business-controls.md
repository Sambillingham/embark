# Business Controls

## 7.1. Accounting System

We will be using Freeagent (http://www.freeagent.com/) as our accounting system, this allows us to easily keep accurate records of transactions, expenditures and receipts ready for our financial documents at the end of the year. Having accurate records that are easily accessed will reduce our cost for processional accountants to produce the financial documents required as a limited company. Pricing for Freeagent is Â£25 per month (see appendix )

## 7.2. Customer Relationship Management

When we begin business we'll be using a spreadsheet to organise our contacts rather than pay for a dedicated CRM software package. Email contacts will be stored within our gmail contacts that works based on our google apps for business account. We realise that a more advanced CRM package will be of use as we grow and we will re-asses our need in the future.

## 7.3. Quality Control

At Embark we pride ourselves on creating polished projects paying close attention to the details and as such it will be important to test and review our projects before making them public.

With the amount of different devices and software available it is important to insure the final product looks as expected to all viewers. We have a testing policy that requires all projects  are tested on multiple browsers as well as multiple mobile devices before being released. 


## 7.4. Professional and Advisory Support

Josh Vincent (Accountant)

Elaine Budd (Events Manager)

Nicola Rose (Tax Consultant)

Laura Billingham (Graduate of BA Events Management)

Liz Cobb (Lawyer)

## 7.6. Growth management

We understand as we grow increasing the amount of work we do, contacts we have and the projects we undertake we will need to expand a number of areas of Embark. Software and Equipment are planned for upgrading/replacing within the financial forecast by the 2nd year of business. Hiring of staff is included in the financial forecast increasing work potential and our day rate in the third year.
