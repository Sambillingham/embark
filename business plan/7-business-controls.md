# Business Controls

## 7.1. Accounting System

Embark will be using Freeagent (http://www.freeagent.com/) as our accounting system, this allows Embark to easily keep accurate records of transactions, expenditures and receipts. Having accurate records that are easily accessed will reduce the cost for processional accountants to produce the financial documents required for a limited company. Pricing for Freeagent is Â£25 per month (see appendix )

## 7.2. Customer Relationship Management

When Embark begins business a spreadsheet will be used to organise our contacts rather than paying for a dedicated CRM software package. Email contacts will be stored within gmail contacts that works based on the business google apps for business account. Embark realise that a more advanced CRM package will be of use as the company grows and the CRM will re-asses in the future.

## 7.3. Quality Control

Embark prides itself on creating polished projects paying close attention to detail and as such it will be important to test and review projects before making them public.

With the amount of different devices and software available it is important to insure the final product looks as expected to all viewers. Embark will have a testing policy that requires all projects are tested on multiple browsers as well as multiple mobile devices before being released. 


## 7.4. Professional and Advisory Support

## 7.6. Growth management

Embark understands with growth, the amount of company contacts we undertake we will need to expand/change a number of areas of business. Software and Equipment are planned for upgrading/replacing within the financial forecast by the 2nd year of business. Hiring of staff is included in the financial forecast increasing work potential and our day rate in the third year.
