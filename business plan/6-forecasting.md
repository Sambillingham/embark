## 6.1 Opening Day Balance Sheet

To help Embark Creative Agency start up and survive for the first year, all three of the founding members will invest £500. This gives us an initial balance of £1500.

For the first year, all founding members plan to rent out a house to live and work in. They will use one room in the house for their working environment. Therefore, bills such as gas, electricity and water will be covered by their own personal funds and will not need to be accounted for by the company.

At startup, investment in any equipment in not necessary. Between the three directors, all equipment needed to work effectively for at least the first year is available. If any extra equipment is needed, this can be hired out.

**Startup Costs**
*Professional Fees*
£15 will pay for the company house registration fee and all other startup documentation will be completed with an accountant. Frances Clark Chartered Accountants have quoted £250 for this, as well as £1000 for a shareholders agreement (see Appendix H).
*Server Management*
A server will be needed to run work on, so for this a server management system will be invested in. This will need to be paid monthly, but an initial payment of £60.80 will need to be paid to cover the first month.
*Domain Name*
On this server, Embark will host it's own website. The domain name for this will cost £7.
*Cloud Backup*
To cover against loss of data, the Google Cloud Platform will be used. This will cost £11.50 as an initial payment to cover the first month (see Appendix K).
*Networking*
£10 has been set aside from the initial investment to pay for business cards. The three directors plan to go to networking events to spread the Embark name, so for these events business cards are essential.

Given the initial investment, after the startup costs have been paid, Embark will start with a positive balance of £145.70 

## 6.2. Sales Forecast

The work has been divided into four categories. These are Promotional Jobs, Small Jobs, Medium Jobs, and Large Jobs.

Promotional work is small jobs that will be done at a cut price of £200 per day. The reason for this is to generate enough work to put together a reputable portfolio. Promotional work will include work for universities, schools and charities. This type of work will be aimed for during the early stages of the company only.

Small Jobs are Jobs that will take between one and three days. This could be micro sites, small visualisations or short videos.

Medium Jobs could be multiple small jobs for a single company or a small scale campaign. These jobs will take between three to ten days each.

Large Jobs are any jobs that take longer than ten days. These are the jobs that the company will aim to focus on more an more as the it grows. Large jobs are full campaigns to promote products, services, brands or events.

For the first year, £400 will be charged per day for the company's services, increasing to £500 in the second year and £600 in the third year.

The assumption has been made that there are 20 working days every month. Another assumption has been made that the company will be able to take half of the money from any job up front, with the other half being received when the job is completed. This assumption has been followed through to the cash flow, receiving half of the money for any work taken on in that month, as well as the remaining half of the money for work taken on in the previous month.

In the first month, it is projected that will be around five days of work for promotional jobs. The other 15 days will be spent networking to increase publicity, as well as on research and development.

As the year progresses, we will predict we will get 2-3 days promotional work per month and 4-5 days of small jobs per month.

By month four, Embark hopes to have received it's first medium job, and by month seven, it hopes to have received it's first large job.

As the year progresses, the company will be woking more days of the month, with less time available for networking.

After the first year, promotional work will no longer be taken on. All work from this point on will be charged at full price.

The assumption has been made that during the second and third years, the amount of Small Jobs received will decrease, whilst the frequency of Medium and Large Jobs will Increase.

**Monthly Payments**
*Business Insurance*
Business insurance is a necessity to protect from many issues that may arise as during trading. Appendix J shows the business cover that will be received and how much it costs. The insurance will cost £48.79 per month.
*Business Space*
Although all members will be working from a house, they will still need a professional environment to meet people and to register as a company address. For this, the Plymouth Formation Zone at the University will be used. This will cost £108 per month, and will provide additional support in the form of one to one sessions with business guidance through Solutions for Business providers. Access to start up resources and links to Plymouth University research expertise will be available, as well as being in an environment where knowledge can be shared with other start-up companies.(see Appendix I)
*Internet*
Internet access is extremely important for the company, and for adequate internet, as well as a landline phone, £65 will be paid each month.
*Version Control System*
A version control system will also be needed to allow for easy versioning and collaborative work. This will cost £17 per month. 
*Accounting Software*
The accounting software, 'Free Agent' will be purchased to can manage finances. This will cost £25 per month (see Appendix M).
*Cloud Backup*
This will cost £11.50 per month (see Appendix K)

'Google Apps For Business' is another online software that will be required. This will be free for the first month, and £9.90 for every month thereafter (see Appendix L).
*Project Software*
Other software needed for day to day company work will cost £146.64 per month
*Server Management*
This will total £60.80 per month.
*Wages*
we will not pay ourselves for the first two months to get Embark off the ground. After this, each director will receive £900 per month. This ensures that we stay in the positive whilst spending time networking.

*End of year payments*
At the end of every year, £15 will be paid to renew the company house license. £400 will be paid to a fully qualified accountant to check our company books. 

Corporation tax will also need to be paid. This currently stands at 20%.

At the end of the first year, £1000 will be invested into new company equipment. This will include a camera and new hardware for developing projects.

During this first year, the company's balance stays positive, with a closing balance of £3729.04. 

## 6.4. 3 Year Cash Flow Projection

(see Appendix B)

The amount that Embark charges for its services per day will increase to £500 in the second year, and to £600 in the third year.

The wages of the three directors will increase to £1500 per person per month in the second year, and to £2500 per month in the third year. At the start of the third year, we will also take on our first employee at £2000 per month.

After the first year of trading, Embark Creative Agency will need to relocate to an office space to help growth. A suitable office will cost £240 per month, replacing the expenditure that was paying for the Plymouth Formation Zone in the first year.

Other changes that will need to be made after the first year are upgrading the version control system to a package that costs £34 per month, and upgrading the cloud backup storage from 200GB each to 400GB each.

At the end of the second year, £500 of the initial investment will be paid back, with the remaining amount paid back at the end of the third year.

At the start of the third year £10,000 will be invested into new equipment, including new computers/laptops.
