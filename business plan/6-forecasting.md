## 6.1 Opening Day Balance Sheet

To help Embark Creative Agency start up and survive for the first year, all three of the founding members will invest £300 each. This gives us an initial balance of £900.

For our first year, we are planning to rent out a house to live and work in. We will use one room in the house for our working environment. Therefore, bills such as gas, electricity and water will be covered by ourselves and will not need to be accounted for by the company.

We will need a server to run our work on, so for this we will invest in a server management system. This will involve an initial payment of £60.80 to cover the first month, with the same fee payable each and every month thereafter.

On this server, we will host our own website. The domain name for this will cost £7.

We will need a cloud back-up service to cover us against loss of data. For this, we will use the Google Cloud Platform. This will cost £11.50 as an initial payment to cover the first month, with the same fee payable each and every month thereafter (see appendix G).

[company house registration and professional fees]

Business insurance is a necessity to protect us from many issues that may arise as we trade. Appendix F shows the business cover we will receive and how much we will pay. Our insurance will cost £48.79 per month.

We have set aside £10 from our initial investment to pay for business cards. We plan to go to networking events to spread our name around, so for these events business cards are essential.

Although we will be working from a house, we will still need a professional environment to meet people and to register as our company address. For this, we plan to use Plymouth Formation Zone at the University. This will cost £108 per month, and give us addition support in the form of one to one sessions with business guidance through Solutions for Business providers. We will also get access to start up resources and links to Plymouth University research expertise, as well as being an environment where we can share knowledge with other start-up companies.

Internet access is extremely important for our company, and for adequate internet, swell as a landline phone, we will pay £65 per month.

We will also need a version control system to make collaborative work effective. This will cost £17 per month. 'Google Apps For Business' is another online software we will squire. This will be free for the first month, and £9.90 (3 x £3.30), with the same fee payable each and every month thereafter see Appendix H).

Accounting software will be purchased so we can manage our finances. This will cost £25 per month.

Other software needed for day to day company work will cost us £146.64 per month. We could buy this up front, but by paying monthly, we will spread our costs and have access to updates.

At startup, we will not need to invest in any equipment. Between the three of us, we own the equipment needed to work for at least the first year.

## 6.2. Sales Forecast

We have divided up the work we do into four categories. These are Promotional Jobs, Small Jobs, Medium Jobs, and Large Jobs.

Promotional work is small jobs that we will do a cut price of £200 per day. The reason for this is to generate enough work to put together a reputable portfolio. Promotional work will include work for universities, schools and charities. We will aim to get this type of work for the early stages of our company only.

Small Jobs are Jobs that will take between on and three days. This could be micro sites, small visualisations or short videos.

Medium Jobs could be a multiple small jobs for a single company or a small scale campaign. These jobs will take between three to ten days each.

Large Jobs are any jobs that take longer than ten days. These are the jobs that our company will aim to focus on more an more as the company grows. Large jobs are full campaigns to promote products, services, brands or events.

We have made the assumption that there are 20 working days every month.

In the first month, we will project that we will get around five days work for promotional jobs. The other 15 days will be spent networking for to increase our own publicity, swell as on research and development.

Over months two and three, we predict that we will receive some smaller jobs, whilst still receiving promotional work.

By month four, we hope to have received our first medium job, and by month seven, we hope to have received our first large job.

As the year progresses, we will be woking more days of the month, with less time spent on networking.

## 6.3. 12 Month Cash Flow Projection

## 6.4. 3 Year Cash Flow Projection

## 6.5. Cash Flow Projection

We have made the assumption that we will be able to take half of the money from any job up front, with the other half being received when the job is completed. We have followed this assumption in our cash flow, receiving half of the money for any work taken on in that month, as well as the remaining half of the money for work taken on in the previous month.

For the first year, we will charge £400 per day for our services, increasing to £500 in the second year and £600 in the third year.

After the first year, we will not take on any promotional work. All work will therefore be charged at full price.

We have made the assumption that during the second and third years, the amount of Small Jobs we receive will decrease, whilst Medium and Large Jobs will Increase.

During the first two months, we will not pay out any wages. The three directors will not be paid. This is justified because there is enough money from savings to live off during this time. From the third month to the end of the first year, the three directors will be paid £900 each per month. During this first year, the company balance stays in the positive, with a closing balance of £4894.04. This is after paying half of the initial investment back to the three directors, as well as paying £415 to renew our company house licence, and to get our accounts checked by a fully qualified accountant. This payment will be a recurrent amount payable at the end of each year.

At the end of the first year, with a balance of almost £5000, we will invest £1000 into new company equipment. This will include a camera and new hardware for developing projects. The wages of the three directors will also increase to £1500 per person per month.

After the first year of trading, Embark Creative Agency will need to relocate to an office space to help growth. A suitable office will cost £240 per month, replacing the expenditure we was paying for the Plymouth Formation Zone in the first year.

Other changes that will need to be made after the first year are upgrading our version control system to a package that costs £34 per month, and upgrading out cloud backup storage from 200GB each to 400GB each.

At the end of the second year, we will pay back the remaining total from the initial investment from all three directors, leaving a closing balance of over £28,000. Going into the third year, the wages of the three directors will increase to £2500 per person per month. At this time, we will also aim to take on our first employee at £2000 per month.

At the start of the third year we will invest £10,000 into new equipment, including new computers/laptops.
