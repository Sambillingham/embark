## Risk and assumptions

### Start-up
To help Embark Creative Agency start up and survive for the first year, all three of the founding members will invest £300 each. This gives us an initial balance of £900.

For our first year, we are planning to rent out a house to live and work in. We will use one room in the house for our working environment. Therefore, bills such as gas, electricity and water will be covered by ourselves and will not need to be accounted for by the company.

We will need a server to run our work on, so for this we will invest in a server management system. This will involve an initial payment of £60.80 to cover the first month, with the same fee payable each and every month thereafter.

On this server, we will host our own website. The domain name for this will cost £7.

We will need a cloud back-up service to cover us against loss of data. For this, we will use the Google Cloud Platform. This will cost £11.50 as an initial payment to cover the first month, with the same fee payable each and every month thereafter.

We have set aside £10 from our initial investment to pay for business cards. We plan to go to networking events to spread our name around, so for these events business cards are essential.

Although we will be working from a house, we will still need a professional environment to meet people and to register as our company address. For this, we plan to use Plymouth Formation Zone at the University. This will cost £108 per month, and give us addition support in the form of one to one sessions with business guidance through Solutions for Business providers. We will also get access to start up resources and links to Plymouth University research expertise, as well as being an environment where we can share knowledge with other start-up companies.

Internet access is extremely important for our company, and for adequate internet, swell as a landline phone, we will pay £65 per month.

We will also need a version control system to make collaborative work effective. This will cost £17 per month. 'Google Apps For Business' is another online software we will squire. This will be free for the first month, and £9.90, with the same fee payable each and every month thereafter.

Accounting software will be purchased so we can manage our finances. This will cost £25 per month.

Other software needed for day to day company work will cost us £146.64 per month. We could buy this up front, but by paying monthly, we will spread our costs and have access to updates.

At startup, we will not need to invest in any equipment. Between the three of us, we own the equipment needed to work for at least the first year.
