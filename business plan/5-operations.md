# Operations

## 5.1. Production

Being digital based our workflow will be based around our personal workstations. We will meet clients in person at our premises and/or communicating via phone/email. we can arrange to meet clients at scheduled time depending on the length of the project.

We are purchasing a 'google apps for business' account for £3.30 per user costing a total of £9.90 which will allow us a number of benefits. We will us professional email using our domain @thisisembark which is easily setup and maintained through gmail. Group calendar functionality to easily see when we are working, when client work is due, when staff members are away etc.

We are using Git as our version control system while using Github for a remote back for all of our projects and where appropriate to host our projects for outside interaction/integration. Backups will all be stored in the cloud within our google apps for business packages where we have purchased additional storage space to accommodate a growing number of projects and required space.

Vimeo will be used to host our finalised video production work, A Vimeo Plus account costs approximately £6 a month varying with USD exchange rate. A Vimeo Plus account allows for the increased   available upload amount that we will require when creating video productions both for our own publicity and for client work.


When work is completed and approved with clients we will us a managed VPS service to host the work we have created. A managed system still allows us additional control where we may need out of the ordinary web services for innovative projects but takes away the haste and time restraints of managing our own server and the technical difficulties and responsibilities that comes with that.

## 5.2. Premises

Embark consists of three founders all sharing a small 3 bedroom rental house in Plymouth which will act as our main place of work. The Formation Zone at Plymouth university will act as our business and postal address and location for meeting with clients. 

## 5.3. Proposed Location

Embark will be located in the city of Plymouth within the United Kingdom. Our proposed location is using space within the formationZone, the most basic plan costing £108 per month for the first year allows us a professional place to meet our clients and a professional postal address. The formation Zone gives us access to professional financial and business advice, there are also advantages being located with other business which offer networking opportunities. The formation Zone is located on the Plymouth university campus in the city centre of Plymouth. This is a central and convenient place for arranging meetings with clients, we will be able to locate our housing anywhere with relatively close walking distance where the majority of our production work will take place. 

## 5.4. Hours of Operation

Primary hours of work will be regular offices hours 9∫am - 5pm, this allows us to accommodate our clients and other business that we will need to be in regular contact with. We understand that our hours may vary on occasion and may extend past the 8 hours a day and 9-5 timeframe but aiming to still working under 48 hours a week per staff member.

## 5.5. Equipment

Each founder at embark currently owns there own computer which will be used as their workstation, theses machine will be used for all of our production work as outlined in our risk and assumptions section earlier. We also own all necessary accessories to complement our workstations. We have a cannon 600D DSLR which is used for client video production and Arduino and Raspberry Pie equipment for physical computing and innovative project prototyping. 

There are no current plans to purchases any new equipment before we begin operations. We may require to rent equipment on a per project bases but costs will be absorbed within the payment of the project where necessary.
